## CHECK 36 - DO WE HAVE A MESSAGE / ENDING OF THE GAME WHEN ALL COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN ANSWERED?

### Why is this important?

Providing feedback to players when they complete the game enhances user experience and satisfaction. It gives players a sense of accomplishment and closure, encouraging them to play again or share their experience with others.

### How to check?

1. Start a game session and answer all the countries presented.
2. Observe if there is a message or indication that the game has ended successfully.
3. Check if there are options to restart the game, view scores, or return to the menu.

### Expected Outcome

When all countries have been answered, the game should display a message such as "Congratulations! You've completed the game!" or "Well done! You've answered all countries." Additionally, there should be options for the player to restart the game, view their score, or return to the main menu.

### If the check fails

If there is no message or indication that the game has ended after all countries have been answered, consider implementing a feature that provides this feedback. This could involve adding a modal popup, an alert, or a dedicated end-of-game screen that congratulates the player and offers options for next steps.

### Results

The check was performed and the following results were observed:

- Upon cmpleting the game, nothing is displayed to indicate the game has ended.
- There are no options presented to restart the game, view scores, or return to the menu.
- Clicking on submit button when there are no more countries increases the final score for no reason.

### Recommendations

To enhance the user experience, it is recommended to implement an end-of-game message that congratulates players on completing the game. Additionally, provide options for players to restart the game, view their scores, or return to the main menu. This can be achieved through a modal popup or a dedicated end-of-game screen. Also prevent score changes after the game has ended to maintain score integrity.
